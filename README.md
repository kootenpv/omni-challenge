# Omni Challenge

Write a script that uses as many of your open source packages as possible

See an example [here](https://github.com/kootenpv/omni-challenge/blob/master/kootenpv/README.md)

## Rules:

- Keep the code as small as possible
- Apart from your own packages, you can only use standard library
- Alright.... 1 external package written by someone else is allowed
- Go for the crazy combo, the funnier the better
- Though useful also "helps your score"
- Comment code whenever neccessary
- 50 lines max (line_length=100, autopep8)
- Code has to run
- Have fun

## How to participate

1. Fork project.
2. Add your github username as folder.
3. Fill it with:

    - README.md (containing required setup and what the script does)
    - omni.py   (your code; could be omni.js)

4. Commit in your branch
5. Make Pull Request, it will be merged
